<p>A DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) is an acoustic Doppler instrument which has the ability to estimate the velocity relative to the bottom (Earth being the frame of reference) or relative to the water.</p>

<p>The DVL comes with a high precision pressure sensor, which provides a means to estimate depth,
and a temperature sensor that provides data used for calculating speed of sound. Further to this, it
has acoustic beams oriented in a diverging, convex configuration, and each beam provides an
estimate of range so that the altitude over the bottom may be estimated.</p>
