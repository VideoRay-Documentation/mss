<p>For operation of the manipulator, see the section about the hand controller.</p>

<p>The manipulator includes 5 interchangeable heads for specific grasping, collecting and cutting applications.</p>

<p>The manipulator is mounted on a two position retractable mechanism.  It can be positioned straight ahead or angled down 30 degrees.  The vehicle auto pitch can be used to pitch the manipulator down even farther, up to vertically straight down.</p>

<p>The manipulator should be retracted for storage and transport.</p>
