<h1>ROV</h1>

<p>The MSS ROV consists of modular components (thrusters, lights, cameras, sensors) and a custom frame.  Each MSS vehicle is designed to meet the requirements of a specific underwater mission.  The frame and sensor payload can be optimized to deliver the vehicle to its intended destination and accomplish the tasks, whether that be recording video, taking measurements of various parameters, or navigation and remote sensing such as sonar or laser imaging.</p>
