<h1>Auto Roll</h1>

<p>Auto Roll can be used to maintain an existing roll, or roll the vehicle to a specified roll.  Auto Roll is designed to be as seamless as possible so that you can pilot without having to constantly engage and disengage it when alternating between hovering and changing roll.

<h2>How Auto Roll Works</h2>

<p>When Auto Roll is engaged, the ROV will automatically respond to changes in roll (measured by the IMU in the NAV module) by applying vertical thrust to maintain the current roll.<p>

<h2>Using Auto Roll to Maintain Pitch</h2>

<p>To engage Auto Pitch, click on the Auto Roll button.  This will engage Auto Roll at the current Roll. You will also notice a roll value in square brackets in the text overlay.  This indicates the target roll.  To roll the vehicle to a new roll,  type in the desired Pitch next to the Auto Pitch button and click the Apply button.</p>
