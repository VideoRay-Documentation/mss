<h1>Waypoint Route</h1>

<p>Waypoint Routes can be defined and the vehicle will follow the course defined by the waypoints.  Waypoints can be selected by mouse or entered by coordinates.  Course controls include setting a tolerance for establishing whether a waypoint is achieved or not, head towards waypoint or crab, speed between waypoints and whether depth should be considered a criteria for achieving a waypoint or not (the system will try to achieve the waypoint depth, but this feature allows the course to continue if the depth is not achieved).  There are also override controls that can be used during the waypoint route following to change the order or speed of the course.</p>
