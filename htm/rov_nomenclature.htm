<h2>ROV Orientation and Directions Reference</h2> 

<p>Bow</b> - The front of the ROV.</p>

<p>Stern</b> - The rear of the ROV</p>

<p>Port</b> - The left side of the ROV when facing forward.</p>

<p>Starboard</b> - The right side of the ROV when facing forward.</p>

<p>Fore</b> - Towards the front or The forward direction.</p>

<p>Aft</b> - Towards the rear of the rearward direction.</p>

<p>Surface</b> - To ascend or move up in the water column to a shallower depth.</p>

<p>Dive</b> - To descend or move down in the water column to a deeper depth.</p>

<h2>ROV Attitude and Motion Reference</h2>

<p><b>Surge</b> - Forward and Reverse motion of the ROV, forward is positive.</p>

<p><b>Heave</b> - Up and Down motion of the ROV, up is positive.</p>

<p><b>Sway</b> - Left (to port) and Right (to starboard) lateral motion of the ROV, left is positive.</p>

<p><b>Yaw</b> - Right (to starboard) and Left (to port) rotational motion of the ROV, right (clockwise, viewed from the top) is positive.</p>

<p><b>Pitch</b> - Bow Up or Bow Down inclination of the ROV, bow up (clockwise, viewed from the port side) is positive.</p>

<p><b>Roll</b> - Port UP or Port Down relative to Starboard, port up (clockwise, viewed from the rear) is positive.</p>
