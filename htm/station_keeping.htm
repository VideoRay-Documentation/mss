<h1>Station Keeping</h1>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Station Keeping requires a DVL.</p>

<p>Station Keeping will maintain the current location of the vehicle.  If auto heading and/or auto pitch is on, the orientation will be maintained as well.</p>

<p>Auto modes will only maintain a specific parameter and if there are currents or the tether is pulled, the location may change.</p>
