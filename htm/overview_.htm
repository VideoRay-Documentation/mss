<p>The VideoRay Mission Specialist Series is the world's first ROV to put project requirements before vehicle design.  Mission Specialist ROVs are literally built around the payload instead of figuring out how to adapt an existing vehicle platform in order to mount the payload.  The overall system represents the difference between a pickup truck and purpose-built construction vehicles, with equal difference in performance for specific applications.</p>

<p>Based on modular components and standard interfaces, the development a specific Mission Specialist Series ROV is orders of magnitude faster than designing a vehicle form the ground up or customizing an existing monolithic vehicle.</p>
