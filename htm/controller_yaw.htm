<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Rotate the Joystick to the left to turn (yaw) the ROV to its left.  Rotate the Joystick to the right to turn (yaw) the ROV to its right.</p>

<p>Displace the Joystick to the left to slide the ROV to its left.  Displace the Joystick to the right to slide the ROV to its right.</p>

<p>The greater the displacement from the center position, the faster it will move or turn in that direction.</p>

<p>The joystick can be moved in any direction to simultaneously turn while moving forward/backward or laterally.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Do not run the horizontal thrusters in air for an extended period of time.  Doing so may cause overheating and damage to the components.</p>
