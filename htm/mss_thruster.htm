<p>MSS vehicles use a modular thruster configuration that allows vehicle designs to be optimized for water conditions and payload delivery requirements.  Modular thrusters are also easy to replace in the field.</p>

<h2>Thruster Propeller</h2>

<p>The propellers are designed to be used on counter-rotating thruster arrangements to eliminate torque roll or yaw.  Propellers are identified by their pitch orientation using left and right based on their use on VideoRay Pro 4 ROVs.</p>

  <li>Left-handed propellers have blades that appear to curve clockwise when viewed from the rear.<br /><img src="../../pro_4/images/propeller_left.png" width="200"></li>
  <li>Right-handed propellers have blades that appear to curve counterclockwise when viewed from the rear.<br /><img src="../../pro_4/images/propeller_right.png" width="200"></li>
