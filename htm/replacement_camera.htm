<h1>Camera Replacement</h1>

<p>Replacing a Camera requires hardware replacement.  Currently, the Camera will be pre-configured when delivered, so there is no need for software configuration procedures.

<h2>Hardware Replacement</h2>

<p>To remove and replace a Camera, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Power down the system.<p></p></li>
  <li>Remove the top float block by removing the four screws holding the float block to the frame.<p></p></li>
  <li>For the Camera to be replaced, follow the Camera cable to the Communications Module and remove it noting its location.<p></p></li>
  <li>Carefully thread the disconnected cable and connector back through the frame until it is clear.<p></p></li>
  <li>Using a Phillips head screw driver, loosen the 4 screws (2 in each bracket) that hold the Camera to the frame.<p></p></li>
  <li>Slide the camera out of the brackets from the front of the vehicle.<p></p></li>
  <li>Slide the replacement Camera cable and then the replacement camera into the brackets and make sure it is level with the tilt gear on the right (when viewed from the front of the camera) and secure it using the Phillips head screws loosened earlier.  Tighten the screws evenly and do not over-tighten the screws.<p></p></li>
  <li>Thread the cable and connector through the same routing as the old Camera. Connect the cable to the same location on the Communications Module as before.<p></p></li>
  <li>Replace the float block using the screws removed earlier.<p></p></li>
  </ol>
