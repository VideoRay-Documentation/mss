<h1>Auto Modes</h1>

<p>Auto Modes on the MSS operate differently than on the Pro 4.  On the Pro 4, auto modes are engaged when the inputs (heading or depth) are in their neutral position.  When the operator applies input, auto mode temporarily disengages and reengages when the input is returned to neutral.</p>

<p>When in auto flight mode on the MSS, joystick inputs control set points.  When the input is neutral, the set point remains constant.  Inputs are used to control the set point.  Auto modes are much more fly-by-wire.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with auto modes of the Pro 4, caution should be observed to monitor the set point.</p>
