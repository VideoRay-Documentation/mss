<h1>Defender Buoyancy</h1>

<p><img src="../images/float_block_defender.png" width="600"></p>

<p>The MSS buoyancy consists of a top float block made of buoyant material.  The purpose of the float block is to offset the weight of the vehicle structure and modules to achieve a neutral buoyancy.  The float block is usually designed with extra flotation capacity to allow accessories to be mounted to the vehicle.  Ballast weights are then added to fine tune the buoyancy depending on the payload and whether the ROV will be used in fresh or salt water.</p>

<p>The Defender float block is secured to the vehicle using 4 screws.  It can be removed to access modules and connections.</p>
