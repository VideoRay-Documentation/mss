<h1>AHRS Replacement</h1>

<p>Replacing an AHRS requires hardware replacement.  Currently, the AHRS will be pre-configured when delivered, so there is no need for software configuration procedures.

<h2>Hardware Replacement</h2>

<p>To remove and replace an AHRS, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Power down the system.<p></p></li>
  <li>Remove the top float block by removing the four screws holding the float block to the frame.<p></p></li>
  <li>For the AHRS to be replaced, follow the AHRS cable to the Communications Module and remove it noting its location.<p></p></li>
  <li>Carefully thread the disconnected cable and connector back through the frame until it is clear.<p></p></li>
  <li>Using a Phillips head screw driver, remove the 2 screws that hold the AHRS to the frame.<p></p></li>
  <li>Remove the damaged AHRS from the vehicle.<p></p></li>
  <li>Mount the replacement AHRS on the frame and secure it using the Phillips head screws removed earlier.<p></p></li>
  <li>Thread the cable and connector through the same routing as the old AHRS. Connect the cable to the same location on the Communications Module as before.<p></p></li>
  <li>Replace the float block using the screws removed earlier.<p></p></li>
  </ol>
