<h1>Course Following</h1>
 
<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Course following modes require a DVL.</p>

<p>While auto modes maintain specific parameters, course following allows operators to direct the motion of the vehicle by means other than the joystick.  This includes moving the vehicle in incremental amounts, going to specific locations, or setting up a course to follow.</p>
