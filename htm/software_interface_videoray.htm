<h1>VideoRay Interface Overview</h1>

<p>There are four applications that are required to operate the VideoRay vehicle control software.  These are stored in the <span class="folder">~/Flighthack</span> folder.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start the thruster controls using <span class="folder">vr_engage.py</span></li>
  <li>Start the camera controls using <span class="folder">vr_engage_camera.p</span>y</li>
  <li>Start the video window<br />
<img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Video is automatically in record mode when the video window is started.<br />
<img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> When stopping video, you must enter CTRL-C in the text window to close the file properly.</li>
  <li>Start the manipulator controls (optional) using <span class="folder">vr_engage_manip_rotating.py</span></li>
  </ul>

<p>Each application may be started in any sequence, but following a consistent sequence such as above is recommended.</p>
