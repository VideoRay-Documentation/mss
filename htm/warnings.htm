<p><a href="equip_tether.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> The tether connectors should be kept clean to avoid abrasion and corrosion on the electrical contacts and damage to the rubber insulation.  Tether connectors should not be lubricated with petroleum products or grease.  Petroleum will degrade the rubber and grease will attract dirt and lead to abrasion and corrosion.  VideoRay recommends lubricating the tether connectors with pure silicone spray.</p>
<p><a href="equip_tether_specs.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> These values are breaking strength.  The tether should not be subjected to a working strength greater than one half of the breaking strength.  The ROV and tether are equipped with a strain relief cable and connectors, which are rated at 136 kilograms (300 pounds).  The strain relief cable should be used to avoid separation of the tether connectors and loss of the ROV.</p>

<p><a href="mnt_best_care.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Use care when cleaning the pressure sensor to avoid damaging the sensor.

<p><a href="pilot_tools.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Fuse GPS should only be used when Station Keeping and Waypoint Following is Off.  If either is on when Fuse GPS is selected, the ROV may make a rapid and unexpected excursion.</p>
<p><a href="qs_postdive.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Failure to properly maintain the ROV by thoroughly cleaning it after use may dramatically reduce its service life.</p>
<p><a href="qs_predive.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Connecting or disconnecting cables while the system is powered on is not recommended.</p>
<p><a href="qs_predive.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> For the next two steps, do not operate horizontal thrusters out of water for more than 30 seconds to avoid overheating or premature wear of the cartridge seals. 
<p><a href="qs_predive.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> For the next two steps, do not leave the lights on bright for more than 30 seconds while the ROV is out of water to avoid overheating.</p>
<p><a href="special_contaminated.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> While alcohol is noted as an acceptable decontaminant in the US EPA guidelines, it should not be used as a decontaminant for the ROV because it reacts adversely with the main domes and light domes.</p>
<p><a href="special_contaminated.html"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png"></a> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> While alcohol is noted as an acceptable decontaminant in the US EPA guidelines, it should not be used as a decontaminant for the ROV because it reacts adversely with the main domes and light domes.</p>
