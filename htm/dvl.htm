<p>The DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) is an acoustic device that provides the vehicle velocity vector by measuring the Doppler shift of its array of four transducers.  When combined with the compass, the ROV's direction and position can be also calculated.  The position update rate is much faster than with USBL acoustic systems, and can be used to provide feedback for autonomous flight operations.</p>
