<h1>ROV GPS</h1>

<p>The ROV GPS antenna is designed to mount on the ROV and has a retractable mast.  It is installed in the center of the vehicle and can be extended through the whole in the float block.  The mast should be extended for operations and retracted for transport and storage.  The mast is spring loaded to prevent damage from impacts and to allow the tether to slip over it so the mast does not become entangled.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> The ROV GPS mast is intended to provide geolocation information while the ROV is on the surface.  The GPS signals do not penetrate data underwater.  When the ROV submerges, another method of tracking must be used, such as a DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) or USBL (Ultra Short Baseline) acoustic position tracking system.</p>
