Commonly used programs like a file manager and a web browser can be launched from the tool bar on the left.  These operate similar to the Windows versions, but one thing to observe is that the window controls to manipulate or close the window are in the upper left instead of the upper right.  The tool bar can be configured to auto hide, so if it is not visible, just move your mouse against the left side and the tool bar should pop out.  The most commonly used programs include the file manager, web browser and terminal.  The terminal is similar to a DOS window and we will learn more about it later.
